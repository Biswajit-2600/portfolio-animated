1- the social media icons, on hover, should seem like popping out from screen with some animation/enlarge with white color and not just glow.
2- for icons :
	-- icons should show the name of the icon when hovering over them, with a thought cloud like pop up and having the same bg color as the icon.
	-- for social media icons, use normal white colored icons
	-- for skill icons, use their original color
3- for projects:
	-- project should be shown within a 3d laptop with a one-time rotating animation
	-- the project should be shown in card form
4- for contact:
	-- choose whether or not to show email and phone with a copy symbol
- optional:
	-- include a customize button (settings icon -- rotate on hover), having:
		-- light, dim and dark modes
		-- 4 fixed font change options

also, i noticed one more thing and this is very odd thing but i will try to explain it as best as i can.

when i go to the top of the page and reload the page, then when i scroll down to the experience section then this happens.
          -- the experience section animations work very well and they work as intended, when i scroll down, the cards flyin from the right and when i scroll up then the cards disappear and again scrolling down gives the same effect and all of this is great. so far so good.
          -- the only problem is that the progession line on the left doesn't show the gradient colors. it appears dark.


now the second issue.
          -- when i am at the experience section and then reload the page, then the progression line properly shows the color gradients and all but the issue is that now the animations are gone and no matter how much i scroll up or down the flying in animations for each card is not being applied.

the whole situation is confusing for me.

can you analyze what is the issue from my explanation and then do a fix?



add the laptop model to the right side div of project modal. 

please adust the height and width of the laptop model glb file and also adjust its position so that it is visible inside the right div then add it to the right modal so that it is completely visible. currently no model is visible

add mouse drag functionality to it.

aldo add a 45 degree rotate animation to the model using gsap everytime the model comes into view.

the natural default view of the model should be straight and front faced.

when applying gsap animation, the animation should start from the right profile view of the model, then it should rotate clockwise and then come front faced straight to the viewer.

to incorporate this, please make whatever changes you need to make
